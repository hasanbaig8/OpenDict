# Bandit configuration for OpenDict
# Conservative security scanning - only skip clearly acceptable issues

# Skip only the most clearly acceptable warnings
skips = B101,B108

# B101: Use of assert - acceptable in tests (pytest uses asserts)
# B108: Hardcoded temp directory - fixed where possible, remaining uses are in tests

# Keep all subprocess and pickle warnings visible but documented
# These are legitimate security considerations for this application
